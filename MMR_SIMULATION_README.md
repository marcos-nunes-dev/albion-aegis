## Understanding the Output

### Participation Criteria

The simulation shows detailed participation analysis for each guild:

```
üìä GuildName:
   Status: ‚úÖ ELIGIBLE / ‚ùå EXCLUDED
   Fame: 1,234,567 (15.2%) - ‚úÖ
   K/D: 8 (12.5%) - ‚úÖ
   Players: 3 (8.8%) - ‚ùå
   Special: Small Guild
```

**Criteria Requirements:**
- **Fame**: ‚â•15% of total battle fame OR ‚â•1M fame
- **Kills/Deaths**: ‚â•15% of total kills+deaths OR ‚â•12 combined
- **Players**: ‚â•15% of total players OR ‚â•2 players
- **Special Rules**: Single players and small guilds have stricter requirements

### Factor Breakdown

When using `--factors` flag, you'll see detailed factor analysis:

```
üéØ GuildName Factor Breakdown:
   Total MMR Change: +12.45
   Individual Factors:
     winLoss: 1.000 (weight: 35%, contribution: 0.350)
     fame: 0.250 (weight: 15%, contribution: 0.038)
     playerCount: -0.600 (weight: 25%, contribution: -0.150)
     ...
   Total Weighted Score: 0.389
```

**10 MMR Factors:**
1. **Win/Loss (35%)**: Alliance-aware win/loss determination
2. **Player Count Advantage (25%)**: Penalties for numerical advantages
3. **Fame Differential (15%)**: Fame gained vs lost ratio
4. **Opponent Strength (15%)**: Based on enemy MMR vs own MMR
5. **Individual Performance (5%)**: Within alliance performance
6. **IP Level (5%)**: Item Power advantage/disadvantage
7. **Battle Size (5%)**: Battle scale factor
8. **K/D Ratio (5%)**: Kill to death ratio performance
9. **Battle Duration (3%)**: Quick wins vs long battles
10. **Kill Clustering (2%)**: Kill timing and coordination

### Anti-Farming Analysis

Shows how repeated wins against the same opponents are penalized:

```
Anti-farming Factor: 0.750
Original MMR Change: +16.60
Final MMR Change: +12.45
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Testing MMR Improvements
Run the simulation multiple times with different battle IDs to test how changes affect MMR calculations:

```bash
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814359 --all
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814360 --all
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814361 --all
```

### 2. Analyzing Specific Battles
Use detailed flags to understand why certain guilds were included/excluded:

```bash
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814359 --participation --factors
```

### 3. Validating Participation Criteria
Check if participation thresholds are working correctly:

```bash
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814359 --participation
```

### 4. Testing Anti-Farming System
Analyze how anti-farming affects repeated wins:

```bash
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814359 --anti-farming
```

### 5. Alliance Analysis
Understand how alliances affect MMR calculations:

```bash
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814359 --alliances
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No active season found"**
   - Ensure you have an active season in your database
   - Check season configuration

2. **"Battle doesn't meet MMR criteria"**
   - Battle must have 25+ players and 2M+ fame
   - Check battle data quality

3. **"Failed to fetch battle data"**
   - Verify battle ID exists
   - Check API connectivity
   - Ensure battle is not too old

### Debug Mode

For maximum detail, use the `--all` flag:

```bash
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814359 --all
```

This shows:
- Complete guild information
- Detailed participation analysis
- Full factor breakdown
- Anti-farming details
- Alliance relationships

## Integration with Development

### Testing MMR Changes

1. Make changes to MMR calculation logic
2. Run simulation on test battles
3. Compare results before/after changes
4. Iterate until desired behavior is achieved

### Performance Testing

Run simulations on multiple battles to test performance:

```bash
# Test multiple battles
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814359 --all
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814360 --all
yarn mmr:simulate 1268814361 --all
```

### Validation

Use the simulation to validate that:
- Participation criteria work correctly
- Factor weights produce expected results
- Anti-farming system functions properly
- Alliance relationships are handled correctly

## Safety Features

- **No Database Writes**: Simulation never saves data to database
- **Read-Only Operations**: Only reads existing data for analysis
- **Safe to Repeat**: Can run multiple times without side effects
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and missing data

## Performance

- **Fast Execution**: Typically completes in 5-15 seconds
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes data in memory without persistence
- **API Rate Limited**: Respects API rate limits
- **Concurrent Safe**: Can run multiple simulations simultaneously

This tool is essential for understanding, testing, and improving the MMR system while maintaining data integrity and system stability.
