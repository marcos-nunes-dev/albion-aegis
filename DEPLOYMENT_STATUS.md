- [ ] Build and deploy Docker containers
- [ ] Verify all services are running
- [ ] Test health check endpoints

### **Phase 3: Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Configure alerting rules
- [ ] Set up log aggregation
- [ ] Test monitoring and alerting

### **Phase 4: Production Validation**
- [ ] Run full system tests
- [ ] Verify data ingestion is working
- [ ] Check rate limiting behavior
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Validate backup procedures

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **1. Production Environment Setup**
```bash
# 1. Create production environment
cp .env.docker.example .env.production

# 2. Fill in production credentials
# - DATABASE_URL (Supabase/Neon)
# - REDIS_URL (Upstash/Redis Cloud)
# - API_BASE_URL and USER_AGENT

# 3. Test configuration
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

### **2. Database Migration**
```bash
# 1. Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# 2. Run migrations on production
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 3. Verify connection
npx prisma db pull
```

### **3. Docker Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Build and start services
docker compose up --build -d

# 2. Verify services
docker compose ps

# 3. Check logs
docker compose logs -f scheduler
docker compose logs -f kills
docker compose logs -f metrics
```

### **4. Health Checks**
```bash
# 1. Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz

# 2. Check metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics

# 3. Verify data ingestion
# Check logs for successful battle processing
```
